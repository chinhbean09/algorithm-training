Algorithm Training Repository

This repository contains basic and advanced algorithms implemented in Java Core 17, utilizing Java's Collection framework to process data read from text files.

Contents
In this repository, you will find Java source code for algorithms such as:
Generate Getters, Setters automatically and write to file(*)(Class, Inside Class)
Parse File to HashMap (Text Input). Map: Class -> List(Field), Class -> (List(Field(data type)), Field -> Class, Field -> Data type.
Parse Getters, Setters automtically into HashMap and file(all). Map: Field -> Class.getterField(), Field -> Class.setterField().

Will be available soon:
Sorting (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, quicksort)
Searching (e.g., linear search, binary search)
Graph algorithms (e.g., graph traversal, shortest path finding)

How to Use: 
git clone <repository_link>
Open Project
Open the repository using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
Run and Test Algorithms
Modify input parameters in the code to experiment with different data.
Run and verify results to understand how the algorithms work.

Repository Structure
src: Contains source code for the algorithms.
main: Contains source code will run in main.
java: Contains input text files for algorithm testing.
Requirements
JDK 17 (Java Development Kit) or higher version.
IDE or Java compiler to run the source code.
Additional Information:
This repository is created to provide a learning and reference resource for algorithms in Java Core 17. You are free to use, modify, and extend the algorithms herein for learning and practice purposes.
